/******************************************************************************************
The cre8data_EPGXLM7.sas program creates the course data in the data folder and the libname.sas 
program in the main course folder. 

SAS Virtual Labs
- For SAS virtual labs the student simply executes the cre8data_EPGXLM7.sas program and it creates the course data and libname.sas program.

Other SAS Environments
 - For all other SAS environments the student must download and execute the createCourseFiles_EPGXLM7.sas program. That program will unpack the course folders and files and then execute the cre8data_EPGXLM7.sas program to create all course data and libname.sas program in the folder specified in the createCourseFiles_EPGXLM7.sas program.  

The cre8data_EPGXLM7.sas program may contain syntax unfamiliar to the student which is beyond the scope of this course and not expected to be discussed in class.
